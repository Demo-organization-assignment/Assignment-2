This repository contains one *Task.ipynb* file which contains solution of

* Task 1 - Basic docker Commands 
* Task 2 - Run Hello world docker image locally
* Task 3 - Build a Simple Flask App, Create a Dockerfile, Build image using that docker File, Run the image and push it to Dockerhub.
* Task 4 - Automate steps in Task 3 using Github Actions.

I have added screenshots of command with proper comments. 

For task 3 i have used Quote Generator APP, which i build some time ago, and then created a dockerfile and did all the tasks.
Build, run and pushed image for Quote Generator APP.

I have also attached Screenshots for task 4.

Using Github Actions i automated BUILD and PUSH command of docker, and for every push a new docker image is built and pushed to dockerhub.
